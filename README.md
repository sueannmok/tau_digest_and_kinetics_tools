# tau_digest_and_kinetics_tools
Files and programs used for the analysis of tau kinetic curves, trypsin digestion chromatograms, and antibody epitope mapping of trypsin digested tau fragments. Example of the usages of the programs can be found in at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.24.537889v1.

Kinetic parameter extraction - Determines kinetic parameters such as lag time and elongation rate of kinetic curves. Requires macports and XMgrace for usage. XMgrace installation guide can be found here: http://www.phy.ohio.edu/~hadizade/blog_files/XmGrace_Mac.html. 

Tau fragment epitope mapping - Utilizes reactivity of tau antibodies to narrow down the potential identity of trypsin digested tau bands.

Tau fragment profile analysis - Colab notebook which analyzes chromatograms and calculates similarity between curves of the various groups
